        My name is Matthew Philip Gismondi. 
    </h3>
        <p>I was born on Tuesday, October 19, 1976 at 10:25am to Glenda Viola Gismondi Brown and Pedro Abimael Gismondi. I have two brothers, Mark and Michael, both older. I am M3.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>Most of what you have heard about me in the last few years is most likely incorrect. I was blessed, and I was the exception to almost every rule. That was on purpose so that I would not get lost. I was created to stand out. I was not meant to blend in. But I also was not meant to be in the spotlight.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>I am Matty.</p>
	  <p>I am Mateo.</p>
	  <p>I am Mattgismondi, MatchesMonday, MattJumanji,and sometimes just Matt.</p>
	  <p>I am Scissortail Traveler. And Scissortales.</p>
	  <p>I am The Wheelbarrow, Yarrow, The Red Velvet Armadillo, a Shrinking Violet, and a Groundhog.</p>
	  <p>I am Toby's dad, Jasper's caretaker, and Blue's student.</p>
	  <p>I am the Marshal, Mrs. Peacock, Yves L'Concoction, Luc du Miforelp, Moses, a Rebel, and Sherlock.</p>
	  <p>I am Toberius, Petshopboy, Borogove, Inchikapi, and Gnomerath.</p>
	  <p>I am a Dolphin, a Saint, a Crusader, an Eagle, a Viking, a Panther, and a Sooner.</p>
	  <p>I am an artist, a designer, an editor, a gardener, a singer, a bird-watcher, a researcher, and a sugar sculptor.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>There are also people out there who have tried to prevent me from being taken seriously who have made up ridiculous or stupid things that were somewhere along the lines of something I said so that whenever I referred to those things people thought I was talking about rolling cylinders generating energy as you drive over them (obviously they wouldn't) instead of solar panels as roads. Not the best example since I didn't come up with the idea for solar panel roads, but I remember listening to someone suddenly switch into a different nerdy and exaggerated voice as if he were intending to use the sound clip later and lead people to believe that was me. I still can't figure out how or why they did that, but it was not only with things that made me look stupid and like a fake. It was also things that they would do that were very illegal and very harmful to others and yet somehow got tacked onto my list of overlooked deeds. I shouldn't have had any overlooked deeds. But if I had some kind of blessing or free pass because of promises I had made or goals I'd set out that inspired people to the point of offering that to me as a gesture of support, it was quickly turned into a bad situation I am guessing because it was returned with other people who were annoyed with me going out of their way to exaggerate irresponsible behavior and somehow allow people to think it was me.
			  <p></p>
  <p>And to me it is not a matter of just taking one for the team. It is about everyone having their own experiences that are useful for some purpose that God has for them. It is important to be who He made us to be and to be who we are. We should never try to be someone else or try to take the place of someone else. I have no idea where that idea came from, but a lot of people for a long time have been under the impression that I am trying to find a replacement so I can exit life and go to Heaven or something. But if someone were going to take over whatever role I once had, they would take over as themselves. No one can replace another person, but it seems like a lot of people were under the impression that if they got close enough and if they could convince me to talk about liking certain things that they like then they could move in when I secretly disappeared or when an alien popped out of my stomach (which isn't going to happen I'm sorry to disappoint you) and the whole deal would be set up for them to enjoy all the benefits. But I wasn't trying to be ascetic. I wasn't trying to deny myself anything. When I pray the Lord's Prayer, and when I say, "lead us not into temptation," to me the temptation is often waiting too long to buy something that for most people would be a temptation to do it. The temptation is thinking that I can just avoid dealing with the insane amount of trouble and stress, but then when I do every time I regret waiting because my body starts to hurt in ways I didn't even know were possible. But someone else trying to be some kind of public front for something else who for some reason still comes to me every so often as if in need of maintaining that connection for some reason doesn't deal with the same badgering spiritual insanity or the same physical issues that are similar and make it difficult to separate the two or the constant battle of defending myself versus pissing off people in control versus trying to just move on until I realize I can't. But what it comes down to is that God uses everyone the way they are and makes things work together as long as we are seeking Him genuinely and desiring to love Him and love others and also love and be true to ourselves. That is why it is so important for me to say that I am gay. It gives other people hope they might not have. I don't shove anything in anyone's face intentionally, and I don't even have any reason to think that I do at all. If anything I do is leaked somewhere please tell me. And if anyone has been recording me and broadcasting it somewhere please tell me that too because I know someone has been doing something like that. It affects me significantly because somehow I absorb that energy, and it is not healthy. And I have repeatedly asked for it to stop.</p>

	<p>My name is not Bae. It never was, and it pisses me off every time I hear it. The reason is because of what I wrote about in "The Plan" which admittedly is embellished with a lot of details that might be a little crazy but not necessarily made up. Every crazy person's psychosis is based on a certain amount of reality, and sane people would do well to pay attention to that more than they do.</p>
	  
	  <p>My name is Matthew which not only describes me in several ways, but it also has a tag at the end there that clearly states that I belong to Yahweh. The Hebrew ending -yahu means "of Yah", and that is where the -hew (-hu) in Matthew comes from.</p>
        
        <p>I do not identify as Jewish, but every Christian is in a way also a Jew since Jesus Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it which is why the, "It is finished" was significant when He died on the cross.</p>
        
        <p>Yahweh Yeshua is God Almighty and the Divine Creator. His Name is also Jesus Christ. It is because of Him that I exist, and I live my life hoping that I am a good reflection of Him. For this reason it is important that what is in my record actually reflects what I have done, and what is in anyone else's is what they have done. Anything else would be misleading, and that would make us both look bad.</p>
        
        <p>If the truth is not first and foremost in any account of history, how can we learn from it since it is therefore written by fallible human beings with an agenda of their own and not written by the Faithful and True Witness who desires good will and union? He is the only one that we can trust to make all things work out, and He is not an evil tyrant or a condescending dictator. Unless you are His enemy, but I wouldn't wish that on anyone.</p>
