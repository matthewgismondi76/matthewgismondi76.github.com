    <h3>
        My name is Matthew Philip Gismondi. 
    </h3>
        <p>I was born on Tuesday, October 19, 1976 at 10:25am to Glenda Viola Gismondi Brown and Pedro Abimael Gismondi. 
        I have two brothers, Mark and Michael, both older. 
        I am M3.</p>
        
        <p>My name is not Bae. It never was, and it pisses me off every time I hear it. My name is Matthew which not only
        describes me in several ways, but it also has a tag at the end there that clearly states that I belong to Yahweh.
        The Hebrew ending -yahu means "of Yah", and that is where the -hew (-hu) in Matthew comes from.</p>
        
        <p>I do not identify as Jewish, but every Christian is in a way also a Jew since Jesus Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it which is why the, "It is finished" was significant when He died on the cross.</p>
        
        <p>Yahweh Yeshua is God Almighty and the Divine Creator. His Name is also Jesus Christ. It is because of Him
        that I exist, and I live my life hoping that I am a good reflection of Him. For this reason it is important that 
        what is in my record actually reflects what I have done, and what is in anyone else's is what they have done. 
        Anything else would be misleading, and that would make us both look bad.</p>
        
        <p>If the truth is not first and foremost in any account of history, how can we learn from it since it is therefore 
        written by fallible human beings with an agenda of their own and not written by the Faithful and True Witness who
        desires good will and union? He is the only one that we can trust to make all things work out, and He is not an
        evil tyrant or a condescending dictator. Unless you are His enemy, but I wouldn't wish that on anyone.</p>
