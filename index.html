    <h3>
        My name is Matthew Philip Gismondi. 
    </h3>
        <p>I was born on Tuesday, October 19, 1976 at 10:25am to Glenda Viola Gismondi Brown and Pedro Abimael Gismondi. I have two brothers, Mark and Michael, both older. I am M3.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>Most of what you have heard about me in the last few years is most likely incorrect. I was blessed, and I was the exception to almost every rule. That was on purpose so that I would not get lost. I was created to stand out. I was not meant to blend in. But I also was not meant to be in the spotlight.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>I am Matty.</p>
	  <p>I am Scissortail Traveler. And Scissortales.</p>
	  <p>I am Mateo.</p>
	  <p>I am The Wheelbarrow, Yarrow, The Red Velvet Armadillo, a Shrinking Violet, and a Groundhog.</p>
	  <p>I am Toby's dad, Jasper's caretaker, and Blue's student.</p>
	  <p>I am the Marshal, Mrs. Peacock, Yves L'Concoction, Luc du Miforelp, Moses, a Rebel, and Sherlock.</p>
	  <p>I am Toberius, Petshopboy, Borogove, Inchikapi, and Gnomerath.</p>
	  <p>I am Mattgismondi, MatchesMonday, MattJumanji,and sometimes just Matt.</p>
	  <p>I am a Dolphin, a Saint, a Crusader, an Eagle, a Viking, a Panther, and a Sooner.</p>
	  <p>I am an artist, a designer, an editor, a gardener, a singer, a bird-watcher, a researcher, and a sugar sculptor.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>But mostly now I am damaged goods too worn out and frustrated to handle the world.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>I am not Bae. I am not a predator. I am not an angel or a demon.</p>
	  <p>I am not a sex offender, homophobe, masochist, or sadist.</p>
