# matthewgismondi76.github.com --> this is just the originally intended version of my personal website that started here, took a detour through a million other apps and online services, and then came back here with the intention of not using any code that I didn't understand. This entire platform and means of delivering information was created to be efficient and streamlined, and it has become so bloated and unnecessarily difficult even for experts to find out what is going on which makes it a joke should you ever try to get help with someone hacking you. Or you become the joke because either you are not taking your drugs and that gets pointed out or you are taking drugs and that gets pointed out. Either way you lose unless you can prove with absolute certainty and actual physical evidence, but even then you have to give everyone involved a tutorial about everything that you have spent hours researching and trying to make sense of only to realize it is not even possible. Because by the time you figure out what went wrong ten years ago and finally are able to deal with that, you get slapped down with a whole new set of problems, a whole new set of painful experiences, a whole new set of things to learn to protect yourself against, and a whole new layer of trust to accept as working for you and not against you. So hopefully anyone else who ever finds themselves in this position isn't trying to also recover from something that isn't possible to recover from since it affects their baseline and definition of what normal is. In other words, I don't even have a goal to shoot for because I never learned how to succeed with the way my brain works now. But instead of getting to learn all that and find what works for me, I feel coached and pushed and prodded by people who must think that even all of that was just some psychotic excuse to avoid responsibility. I guess there are some people who were in my life I thought because God knew I would need support during a period of hardship, but instead of seeing themselves as stewards of stability and wealth to help those who are messy but are the only ones able to go certain places or do certain things that would normally have helped people, they see themselves as purveyors of tough love and as models of what to expect from good works and fitting in the bell curve as close to the middle as possible. Only part of that is because of a choice they made which is why it is so hard to accept. Especially when you try to ignore the past and focus on moving forward. That tends to cause me to forget that there are still people who are beating dead horses and not seeing that things are better. Or that is a lie and the hope of people who don't want to have to stop what they are doing. Or is it? How much of it would be better if I really did think that it was?
