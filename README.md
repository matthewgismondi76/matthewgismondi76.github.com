I don't write long journal entries to remind myself of what happened already due to memory loss or becauase of a need to refresh myself every day or after I sleep. I do it because I am so used to being abused in ways that are unforgivable, and I need a way to keep track of details should I ever find legal help. The people who have in the past managed to realize that I am a human being and not an angel to exploit have been the ones that burned up all my sketchbooks or deleted all my files online, and I am tired of feeling like I have to shut up or else forfeit some kind of fun that I desperately need. At this point it has moved from need to deep rooted scars that make fun impossible, and it was never even possible to begin with  because of all of the interference. And when those people who thought they were not involved pull out and things come to a screeching halt or move at a snail's pace, how is that not the proof of how wrong that is?

This isn't the first time it has happened either. When it's my body I have faith in Jesus Christ to bind up the wounds behind the removal or purging that I do and fill in the blanks with what should be there. I believe that He does that as much as possible while still making sure there is something to hold those involved accountable. Because it is not acceptable to say that you can poison someone all you want to just to see what happens and then claim you are doing some kind of research. The argument of, "Well Jesus will heal him so it doesn't matter how much it hurts..." is never an acceptable argument any more than it is to say, "I can take his money because Jesus will just give him more..." or about any of the other ways that He tried. Since it turns out He does not in fact do that (and why would He when it would just turn someone into a vending machine for those who did not want to be or who could not be in His presence?) what has happened to me feels like people draining the worldly benefits of someone who really did pay that much into the karma bank and with God keeping up some kind of miraculous healing to keep me just barely alive?

How would He be able to put a stop to something like that without evidence, and how would there be any evidence possible if everyone got healed? The only way to deal with the situation, I guess, is to find the nicest person with the biggest heart and the highest threshold of pain and give the task to them because they would have the best chance of surviving long enough to understand something that is entirely focused on leaving Him out of it. Evidence doesn't mean my own documentation. Anything I know is added to His own files however He stores them. I don't know. But burning me and the things I write as a way to understand and avoid going crazy beyond what I can handle only hurts me and does not benefit anyone else. And trying to make me crazy or trying to make me sleep does not make me forget. It adds to my distrust and adds to my pain.
