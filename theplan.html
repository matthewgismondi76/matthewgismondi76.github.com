Evil has a plan. And it is pure evil. Did anyone see the movie Hellboy? Or Aliens? So imagine a person who was injected with something that was capable of growing inside of that person, slowly replacing tissue with its own non-double helix structure. It is under the disguise of some cancer curing nanobiotech or something that is scouring for the secret of that elusive gene that prevents HIV from taking a foothold. Everyone would be told that it was important not to talk about it because part of the success lies in the technology conforming to the person's beliefs and will. It is related to brain energy somehow in that sense and as long as the person believes they are fine and wills their body to flourish, the technology fights for it and defends it and makes sure that it keeps anything that might threaten that in check. It even has replicated the subject's DNA as its own so that it is considered a friendly and benign component along with the rest of what was already there and that is encoded in the original DNA blueprint. 
 
The subject's use of substances and medication and alcohol and exercise and everything else are taken into consideration and even their drug habit is calculated and included in the design so that the biotech is kept in check by that regular amount that is taken. And if it is not taken, then it starts to grow out of control until it makes so much interference and noise in the communication channels that others use that there is no way to mistake the problem. It's a fool proof way to make sure that if that person is not taken care of then everyone will have to stop and make sure they are or else suffer through the horrible noise.

But there is a problem. Involved in the whole ordeal are those who have other plans for those things. They want to use them as hosts for their own homeless spirit selves since it is very problematic to possess someone without it being noticed and without risking being bound and banished into the Abyss for good. So they decide that they should be entitled to these little creatures that are created through their own nudging humans along the paths of discovery until they finally have a way to inhabit something that allows them also to use the senses of that human. It's the perfect solution to them because they get to share in the senses but without taking over, and no one even notices. But they do notice that their own senses become dull as the nerve endings are rerouted to their own sensors. And they enjoy their new little niche so much that they can't just enjoy a little bit. They start setting up camp in the prime areas like the taste buds and the nostrils and the ears and the nipples and it's like New York City around the sphincter.

They set up shop in the digestive tract too because "technically" that is outside a person since it's just a tube that goes all the way through. I would argue that the sphincter and the lips make it enclosed, but who's splitting hairs about things like that when there are so many other violations of humanity and what should even be allowed by God in the first place. But He probably doesn't know the extent of what they were planning, because as the subject was told, he could have anything he wanted and God would never have to know. So they must have found a way to keep secrets from Him at least temporarily. Or He is just letting them to see how far they will go.

And by the way, the subject did not agree to that offer. The subject was merely told that that was what was being offered to him, and he repeatedly said that he was not interested because he had no need or desire to hide anything from God. And why would someone already stressed out enough about having to hide a drug habit that was purely medicinal by this point in spite of every attempt to enjoy it recreationally as well? There was no fun to be had because someone had known ahead of time that this would be written and felt obligated to use it as a script and probably even blamed the whole thing on the one who wrote it. But that's not possible because the one who wrote it was observing what had already happened. And the one who wrote it only did so because he wanted to make it absolutely clear that he was never even interested in anything that was going on in regard to this plan, that he had rejected it from the beginning, that he was not involved in any of it, that he had been subjected to forced interactions with the other people involved who then would steer the conversation in a direction that made no sense to him, but it was purely a social visit and not even one that he really was expecting or able to handle very well. This is mainly because of the difficulty in trusting people after seeing the consequences of those interactions which resulted in him being pushed further away from any hope for rescue while it was becoming more and more difficult to even prove that he was desperate, which resulted in those people being unaware of the details and strange circumstances involved and making up a best guess when asked that wasn't even close to as bad as it really was, and which resulted in them still getting rewarded while the subject was kept hidden so that no one would threaten the precious thing in his body. He knew those things would happen, but he was unable to avoid it.

Meanwhile, these people that somehow knew parts of the story were supposedly conducting authorized surveillance and were finding out about all the messages being sent to help the subject out. Not realizing that he was dealing with something horrible that was an abomination, truly, of epic proportion, they just saw some idiot who was whining and speaking French all the time and who had a bad attitude because he wasn't getting his way. Part of that was because the people who were in charge of protecting the creature were putting false information out there and not passing on important details like how the subject had a medicinal need for the drugs or that his body would shut down if he didn't get them and that thing would start to chomp its way around inside him which was not something that you want to feel or hear when you are so tired and feel like shit because of the bath salts someone gave you instead of what they took instead to enjoy while munching on someone's pussy. And they have to say pussy as much as possible because the subject is gay and likes to get on his knees and suck dick, but that is not what these predators and thieves like to do since it takes away from their tough side. And for some reason a lot of them tried to make the subject feel like he was supposed to accomadate them. Some even tried to make him feel guilty for not watching more all-inclusive porn. It was selfish of him to just watch what he liked. They got together and all agreed on things like that and then tormented him about it as much as possible. After all, they are all in it together, aren't they? The subject is not sure why that is the belief, and he has repeatedly stated that since this is his physical body being used, there has to be a physical contract authorizing something like that, and he is absolutely certain that he never made any agreement even about something like that. He also knows that someone else was very crafty about things like that and probably assumed that the subject would not live as long as he did, and there are a lot of people along the way who came into a lot of money unexpectedly that they tried to hide but did a terrible job. They all had money or they would not have been so oblivious to things that I needed and was never offered. You wouldn't think about someone needing things if you have no reason to think anyone is in need. Yet even when the subject was talking about being broke and not having enough stuff they jacked the prices up even more for some reason.

Anyway, so this creature is not actually a biological thing that is killed with antibiotics. Some things do affect it like you would expect, but it is more in the sense that it requires a large mass of the tiny components that are like building blocks to come together and store more complex information like memory and purpose. And the most significant piece is wrapped around the skull like a cap that comes down over the third eye, the pineal gland, and manages to grab that energy and reroute it wherever it wants to. It can't get into the brain itself, but it can intercept outgoing nerve impulses or inject its own within reason because it is still subject to the same energy supply that the rest of the body needs. In other words, it doesn't have the ability to do anything hugely destructive, but it did manage to wrap itself around the roots of my molars where it has been punishing me the last few days very severely and in ways that have left me nauseous and doubled over which is a lot for me. I have a high threshold of pain. And I know it is not just a toothache because if I rub certain things on it it will retreat or it will break up that part and the pain instantly stops. Praise Yahweh for simple things from the grocery store stopping nanotech in its tracks. And there are lots of things that work differently, but it seems to adapt to a certain extent. I think if you just find a different variety of papaya, for example, then the genetic difference is just different enough to keep it confused long enough for the papain to prevent its annoying little crust from forming that protects it from everything. I don't know. I studied food science in pastry school and not in some advanced organic chemistry program so my approach tends to be a little more flavorful.

So like Transformers, these things can assemble and break apart. If you get through the crust in some place and start pounding it with a jet of water, it will wash right away with no problem even if it takes a long time. If you don't have constant flow of water then it will turn into what I think is urushiol. This forms a lacquer when mixed with soap that coats your skin and makes you immune to heat temporarily. It actually does and it's really amazing honestly because it is like having a layer of asbestos on your skin. I feel like that was part of the purpose in the design. But it's also a bitch to get off, and I wonder if the UV light actually cures it once the lacquer is there even though normally that will kill it if its not. Calamine lotion mixed with the soap as well as lemon oil seems to be a really good solution because while it does seem to increase with soap and especially with whatever lubricant is used on my bicycle, the lemon soap and calamine are amazingly effective. And also by the way, diatomaceous earth is a great way to scrub through when it forms that layer that it hides underneath. It's just tricky because then it... I mean, like Transformers, they can assemble into what seems like a very large and disgusting creature. Sometimes it feels like a mouse is running around inside you like a pinball bouncing around. I have no idea if that's really happening or if it's part of what it can do being tied into your nervous system so that it can send the same impulses back to your brain that would have normally been felt as the result of something like that. It's the perfect way to torture someone and drive them insane since no one would ever believe that they had a "thinking cap" on that was simulating painful and disturbing things like that without anything actually happening. And the person might actually grow accustomed to it and not even react should any real damage happen since it's just more of the same. That would make it very easy to make them out to be some kind of emotionless sociopath or worse, a fallen angel who feels no pain. And the "thinking cap" creature wrapped around their head would make them look like any other alien / fallen angel from above. And if they were coated in the same kinds of cells all over from that lacquer that they basically dipped in when they took a bath unless they put some alcohol or enzyme or something in the water (salt?) to prevent it from sticking to the skin when they got out... but I am getting sidetracked here. 

What I was trying to say was that the reason I get so irritated about being called Bae is because of what I see as the end game of all of this. What I have already seen is that at certain times when someone says Bae, it means that God is with me. Or it means that He is me. Or He has taken over basically. That is not how He works, but they aren't concerned with the truth and are only concerned with their plan. And this is only referring to the fallen angels and not the watchers who are not associated with them. Someone at some point decided that it was necessary to specify, possibly related to being a witness and giving everyone a head's up that they need to be on good behavior or something like that. I imagine it also has something to do with the other guys who were in the line of people either scamming what I was supposed to be getting so that I could keep pursuing the mysteries of the Bible that were being revealed to me, or else the people who were scamming the angels who were in charge of providing for Jesus when He was on Earth, or something like that. I don't know. I have never tried to scam anyone and I have often even rejected things or ignored them because I felt like it wasn't for me. Not things I desperately needed, but just extras here and there that seemed available. But any behavior like that was seen as an indication that I must not be genuine at all and while I never claimed to be genuinely the Messiah, Jesus Christ, Yeshua, I did claim to have a legitimate and genuine connection with Him and the Father that was real and beautiful and appropriate and awesome. It was significant enough to have gained the attention of a lot of people who were then let down when those other people started taking liberties more and more and taking credit and probably truly starting to think they were someone too. And possibly started thinking maybe they were Jesus. I don't know. 

So Bae is when I was focusing on Jesus earlier on when I first started to notice it. It was how people would indicate that I was focused on reading the Bible and praying and researching Hebrew and Kabbalah. It was in contrast to Matt who was lonely and desperately needing a husband to help keep him grounded and as a sexual outlet so that when he did use drugs he could get that out of the way quickly and in a way that was actually satisfying so that he could move on to focus on the awesomeness of God without the distractions of the physical body. 

Eventually, though, Bae became something else. It became the name of the creature that was supposedly starting to take over Matt and replace his mind with its own. Bae was the alien and Matt was the human. Bae was the menace that was messing up the fun by being persnickety and always cleaning, and Matt was disgusting and filthy and some kind of evil thief that required someone following him around every time he went to the store. And it was that bad. Either people were annoyed because Bae was preventing everyone from having fun, or else Matt was up to no good and couldn't be trusted. Then Bae started to become more and more of a bad thing. Bae was the alien and that is where it starts to get a little scary. Because if you follow that to the next step, then Bae becomes the evil alien creature that took over Matt's body. But the scary thing is that the watchers were taught that Bae was the word of God. Bae was important to listen to because it was Yahweh, and His Will needed to be done. So if Bae was called, then everyone would take anything I said and put it into practice. If it was Matt, they would ignore it. So imagine now that this is going on, but the fallen angels are not telling the watchers that they are slowly evolving Bae into something else. Eventually, Bae becomes its own creature, takes control of Matt's body, and now it is always Bae and everyone is still doing everything Bae says. The fallen angels have confused Matt so much that he doesn't know the difference between them and the watchers. To him, everyone is just a supernatural being that torments him, and he is frustrated and angry at everyone. That's important because that is the only way for Bae to evolve without anyone noticing. And once Bae becomes completely in control, the fallen angels, who have been able to put their spirit into those nano things, now control Bae since it's not technically part of Matt making it inhabitable by a spirit. And then they can take over the world because everyone has to do what Bae says.

But it's not really a threat. There is a flaw. In order to survive so easily and be able to move around so quickly and freely, those nano things had to replicate Matt's DNA. So they are actually now part of his body in a sense. I am supposed to feel like it's a catch 22, because if I say that they are part of my body then I can't say they have no right to use my senses. And if I say they aren't part of my body then I can't say that my body is a temple of the Holy Spirit and they cannot inhabit any of it. But I can. Because they are not part of my original design, for starters. You cannot just go in and steal someone's blueprints, build your own unit in a neighborhood in someone else's yard, and then say that you're part of the neighborhood just because your house matches. People might ignore it and might not even notice if you do it in the right place, but you're going to have trouble with taxes and your mailing address and eventually the owner of the land is going to notice. But also, those things are leeches. They cause horrible damage that they claim to help fix but it wouldn't be there in the first place if they weren't there. And they cause my skin to look like it has syphilis so that they can make sure that no one messes up their creature. Sex chemicals released in the brain are its nemesis, and the penetration causes whatever is in there using up my serotonin to keep me depressed so that it has a better chance of survival to get broken up. This does not mean that people should wait until I am asleep, inject me with something that knocks me out, and then rape me to the point of being bruised and in pain the next day. That does not qualify as anything being done for me, I promise you. I end up hurting, and it is not necessary to be so rough. There are ways to do that where I get to enjoy it too, and if you are going to go to that kind of trouble then there is no reason why anyone involved can tell me that it's wrong for me to have gay sex and do drugs when you are doing it to me already without even asking. If you inject me with something and then rape me, how is that any different than me injecting something and asking someone to fuck me? At least my way doesn't hurt anyone except the alien. And I'm not even sure it's necessary. I just noticed that that one time when I was at the hotel that guy was really trying to stab something in there, and then the next time I pooped it was bright green. And then someone later was telling me about having a miscarriage, so I assumed it was related somehow. But don't go after him. For years people have been really rough like that, and not that there have been that many. But I mean back when I was having sex all the time people would be unusually rough and they seemed to think I expected or wanted it. But now I know the real reason why they have been making sex impossible. Even my parents somehow understood and were trying to urge me to do that without saying so. Maybe it was just their spirit knowing and speaking indirectly, but I don't know. They were definitely not the ones standing in the way after I moved out.

Now I will say this. It very well may be that the fallen angels are not actively trying to destroy God or mess Him up. The fact that this seems to be some kind of world that is set up to be a place where someone has the ability to make things happen however they want seems like it was meant to be a gift of some kind. It may be that they felt like it was unfair to be cast out and cut off after being created for a purpose that they now were not allowed to do. It may feel like they need a drug that they cannot get and have been trying to make me see that as their only hope for being heard. It may be that they saw this world as somewhere else away from God that they considered some kind of option that would allow them to be able to exist however they wanted on their own since there was no hope of being allowed back into Heaven, and maybe they didn't think it was fair to be sentenced to a fate of not existing anymore since no one knows what that is like. If the Abyss is a black hole where even spirits cannot escape, then that sounds like an eternity of something no one could ever describe since who has ever come out of it to say? I suspect that Yahweh did, but that is another story, and one that gives Him in my opinion the right to be in control. He went through hell by Himself and pulled it all together, so He deserves everything. And His Son did too. His Son had the added experience of being human and having to face death, wake up as a spirit and figure out how to get back to humanity. I don't imagine that is an easy thing to do without anyone having done it before. They both went through terrifying experiences that we never even think about, and I never forget that because I have seen enough of what it might possibly be like and I can't even handle a few minutes of feeling like that. But regardless, there is always the argument of the creator being unconditionally responsible for the creation. And I can imagine the amount of bitterness that would have developed over the years and that would make it impossible to even have a discussion about it. But then this is still me, a human, seeing it through the eyes of someone who only understands temporal relationships and cause and effect. I don't know how to break out of that to understand those concrete milestones that were set out beforehand. And I promise you after what I have been through I will be the last one to ever support any of them. Do not mistake this as sympathy. Empathy, maybe just a little bit, but I'll say again that I never wanted to mess up His plan, and I never have felt even the slightest bit of desire to do so because of how much thought and care He put into everything and made sure that no one was even inconvenienced more than they needed to be in the design. We did that to ourselves by not following Him, and if we would I think we would be surprised to find out how easy life would be and how everyone would be happy. More than happy. I believe that there was an attempt to see if they could be rehabilitated, and it seems like they had put on a good show. But there is far too much intentional and deliberate malice and refusal to empathize, but again, that is a human trait that angels may not have needed as much. I don't know. Maybe they have more than we do since they were asked to be protectors and would therefore need to be more in tune to others than themselves even. 

I serve Jesus Christ, and that will never change. I also see Him and Yahweh as two entirely separate beings even though in the beginning they were entirely unified. I believe that was part of the sacrifice that was made by Jesus having a human experience, because I can't imagine how He would have been able to do that and still be in Heaven at the same time making sure everything was held together. In my mind it's like Yahweh split off little slivers of Himself and bestowed them upon people when He found one he liked and wanted to keep, but with Jesus He split Himself in half. I believe that the Preacher in Ecclesiastes was one of the many times He had come to Earth to experience His own creation, and the same with Elijah and some others. But with Jesus it was the first time He had experienced death and He not only braved the cross, but then showed up to Hades and said, "Ummm I want my keys back please." and then had to figure out how to get back to Heaven. I mean, it sounds silly kind of, but seriously that is what He did. And every Christian in this world believes that story which makes it hard to understand how it is so difficult for people to see that some nobody like me could actually be able to walk into situations and intimidate people without even knowing it and say things that hit them hard without knowing it and to have the ability to speak at the right time or to say something that to me is random but somehow causes someone else somewhere else to think that I know everything that they are doing. I don't. I promise you I know nothing. I cannot even connect to God's mind to find out. But He knows and that may be the point. To remind people that He knows everything that they do already so there is no need to hide from Him. He isn't a court that knows nothing about you. He knows everything in your heart and understands why you did whatever you did. You don't have to justify yourself to Him because He knows and He was right there with you to know why you had to do that. Or He knows that you were a piece of shit that was too selfish to care and needed a slap in the face to understand. And He knows that you say shit a lot or that you say fuck every time you lose all your money at the casino. And He hurts with you when you feel guilty about it. He doesn't jump in and possess people. He jumps in and kicks the bad out. Not the illegal. The bad. So there is no reason to fear Him knowing anything because He already does if you let Him. And it's better to let Him because otherwise He'll just be getting the story from other people or a cat or a bird or a cricket or a tree and then it's anyone's guess how much they know about what a human needs. Honestly I say that with a little humor because I don't know what it's like to be Him and I don't know what kinds of information a spirit can use without a physical memory component like a brain. But I do know that He is not the enemy and He is not a booming voice of doom and gloom that condemns everyone and curses them. That is me when I am angry and feel hopeless and like no one will take me seriously if I don't start doing something that hurts. But I never do that in a way that has anything behind it that isn't either already there from someone else sending it my way or else it is from Him and He decides how seriously to take what I say. I am just the butterfly that stamped. The earthquake comes from Him.
