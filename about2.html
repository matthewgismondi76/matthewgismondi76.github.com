And it has been used as a way to hurt people. So DO NOT REFER TO SOMEONE AS BAE unless you know them personally and they like it.">
    <meta name="disclaimer" content="I apologize if this is not as polished and selfless as it should be, but I am sensing a lot of frustration in my focusing so much on myself. I understand the many lessons that were given long ago before the confusion as to why it is important and why it doesn't matter for me to talk about myself. So I will just say that I feel like it is necessary still to say who I am and say who I am not because I still feel cheated and neglected and tortured because instead of hearing me say that I never was the one who benefited from anything that was lavished on so many others I have been pushing through on an empty tank and just got used to that as all that it would ever be. So if I manage to completely remove myself from all of this and focus entirely on God as I should do to make it actually useful, it will be a feat of sheer miraculous everything because after all these years of not only denial but also being teased and promised things that never were, my storehouses of empathy and compassion and love were tapped out long ago and never replenished even close to what they need to be to do what was expected of me. Just be happy that you get anything at this point is what I am trying to say, and do not aim Your anger at me or tell me I need more respect. I don't think You are, but someone is, and they need to realize that this is war and not a garden tea party. Spiritual warfare is real and we have only begun to see what it is capable of in the physical realm."

    <h3>
        My name is Matthew Philip Gismondi. 
    </h3>
        <p>I was born on Tuesday, October 19, 1976 at 10:25am to Glenda Viola Gismondi Brown and Pedro Abimael Gismondi. I have two brothers, Mark and Michael, both older. I am M3.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>Most of what you have heard about me in the last few years is most likely incorrect. I was blessed, and I was the exception to almost every rule. That was on purpose so that I would not get lost. I was created to stand out. I was not meant to blend in. But I also was not meant to be in the spotlight.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>I am Matty.</p>
	  <p>I am Scissortail Traveler. And Scissortales.</p>
	  <p>I am Mateo.</p>
	  <p>I am The Wheelbarrow, Yarrow, The Red Velvet Armadillo, a Shrinking Violet, and a Groundhog.</p>
	  <p>I am Toby's dad, Jasper's caretaker, and Blue's student.</p>
	  <p>I am the Marshal, Mrs. Peacock, Yves L'Concoction, Luc du Miforelp, Moses, a Rebel, and Sherlock.</p>
	  <p>I am Toberius, Petshopboy, Borogove, Inchikapi, and Gnomerath.</p>
	  <p>I am Mattgismondi, MatchesMonday, MattJumanji,and sometimes just Matt.</p>
	  <p>I am a Dolphin, a Saint, a Crusader, an Eagle, a Viking, a Panther, and a Sooner.</p>
	  <p>I am an artist, a designer, an editor, a gardener, a singer, a bird-watcher, a researcher, and a sugar sculptor.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>But mostly now I am damaged goods too worn out and frustrated to handle the world.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>I am not Bae. I am not a predator. I am not an angel or a demon.</p>
	  <p>I am not a sex offender, homophobe, masochist, or sadist.</p>
